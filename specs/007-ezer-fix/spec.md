# Feature Specification: Ezer Bot Dependency Fix

**Feature Branch**: `007-ezer-fix`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ezer fix - lets make ezer bot more professional. today it runs without shaliah-next app being online. this must be something impossible, as it depends on shaliah to authenticate the user (the user reads a QR code in Shaliah to authenticate into Ezer, see its spec.md). so we should create this barrier. It must be simple. If shaliah is offline, Ezer should respond the user with a kindly error message. And this is it, this will be the feature. it also must have a testing mode, that would ignore it and let a test user use the bot. THE SPEC MUST BE MINIMAL, NOT TOO COMPLEX"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Telegram user, I want the Ezer bot to ensure Shaliah is available before allowing access, so that the bot maintains its dependency on the main application for authentication. When Shaliah is offline, I should receive a clear message explaining the situation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Shaliah online - normal operation**
   - **Given** Shaliah application is running and accessible
   - **When** I interact with Ezer bot (send any message)
   - **Then** Ezer bot operates normally
   - **And** authentication and all features work as expected

2. **Shaliah offline - blocked access**
   - **Given** Shaliah application is offline or unreachable
   - **When** I send any message to Ezer bot
   - **Then** Ezer bot responds with a friendly error message
   - **And** the message explains that Shaliah must be online for the bot to function
   - **And** the bot provides guidance on when to try again

3. **Testing mode - bypass dependency**
   - **Given** Ezer bot is configured in testing mode
   - **When** I interact with Ezer bot
   - **Then** Ezer bot operates normally regardless of Shaliah status
   - **And** testing functionality is not affected by Shaliah availability

4. **Shaliah becomes unavailable during session**
   - **Given** I'm already using Ezer bot with Shaliah online
   - **When** Shaliah goes offline during my session
   - **Then** my next interaction with Ezer bot shows the offline message
   - **And** the bot gracefully handles the dependency loss

### Edge Cases

- **Network timeout**: If Shaliah check times out, treat as offline
- **Partial Shaliah failure**: If Shaliah responds but core services are down, treat as offline
- **Testing mode toggle**: Testing mode can be enabled/disabled without bot restart
- **Concurrent users**: Multiple users experience the same dependency check result

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001 (Dependency check)**: Ezer bot MUST check Shaliah availability before processing any user interaction

- **FR-002 (Offline response)**: When Shaliah is offline, Ezer bot MUST respond with a user-friendly error message explaining the dependency

- **FR-003 (Testing mode)**: Ezer bot MUST support a testing mode that bypasses the Shaliah dependency check

- **FR-004 (Health check endpoint)**: Ezer bot MUST have a configurable endpoint or method to check Shaliah availability

- **FR-005 (Graceful degradation)**: When Shaliah becomes unavailable, Ezer bot MUST handle the transition gracefully without crashing

- **FR-006 (Testing mode configuration)**: Testing mode MUST be configurable without requiring bot restart

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 (Performance)**: Shaliah availability check MUST complete within 5 seconds to avoid long user wait times

- **NFR-002 (Reliability)**: The dependency check MUST be robust against network timeouts and temporary Shaliah unavailability

- **NFR-003 (User experience)**: Error messages MUST be clear and helpful, explaining the situation without technical jargon

- **NFR-004 (Logging)**: Dependency check results MUST be logged for monitoring and debugging

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### Constitution Alignment
- [x] **Principle I (Domain-Centric Architecture)**: Requirements expressed in domain language (bot dependency, testing mode)
- [x] **Principle II (MVP-First)**: Scope focused on core dependency enforcement; advanced monitoring can be added later
- [x] **Principle III (Testing & MCP)**: Acceptance scenarios are testable; Chrome DevTools MCP can be used to test bot responses
- [x] **Principle IV (Supabase-First)**: No database requirements for this feature
- [x] **Principle V (Async via poel-worker)**: No long-running operations; dependency check is synchronous
- [x] **Principle VI (TypeScript-First Monorepo)**: Feature affects ezer-bot app within monorepo
- [x] **Principle VII (i18n)**: Error messages should support pt-BR and en-US

---

## Execution Status
*Updated by main() during processing*

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked (none remaining)
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [x] Review checklist passed

## Notes

### Design Philosophy
This feature enforces the architectural dependency between Ezer bot and Shaliah, ensuring the bot cannot operate independently. The testing mode provides flexibility for development and testing scenarios.

### Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
- Advanced health monitoring with detailed status reporting
- Automatic retry mechanisms for temporary Shaliah unavailability
- Admin notifications when dependency issues occur
- Metrics and monitoring for dependency health
